This app is part of a collection of apps that I developed in Flutter with the purpose of mastering the necessary skills for implementing custom UI/UX designs in Android and iOS.

You can find the entire collection of apps in [this blog post](https://dev.to/crivasgomez/flutter-uiux-design-implementations-518i) and all the source code in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/CRivasGomez/flutter-ui-ux-designs).
